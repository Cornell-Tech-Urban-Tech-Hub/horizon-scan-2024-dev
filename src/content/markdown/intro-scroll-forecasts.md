## Six big stories forecast the decade ahead.

The big bubbles at the center of our map are our topline forecasts. Think of these as the front page stories you might read on a news site in 2032. They describe the big directions of change that will shape the journey ahead for everyone.

Three forecasts describe the transformation of "hard" urban systems. <strong class="supercharged">Supercharged Infrastructure</strong> will rewire the city into a deep, actionable web. <strong class="wild-well">Wild + Well</strong> cities will tap advanced biotechnologies to take livability to new heights. And <strong class="resilient">Resilient Corridors</strong> will amplify our efforts to halt climate change and prepare communities for the inevitable shocks to come.

Three more forecasts unpack deep conflicts in "soft" urban systems. <strong class="dark-plans">Dark Plans</strong> designed and enforced by software will shape cities in strange new ways. This will trigger a backlash, giving rise to a <strong class="new-screen">New Screen Deal</strong> that redistributes the risks and rewards of urban tech. Meanwhile, a planetary scale supply chain for city-making technologies will take shape as <strong class="urban-innovation">Urban Innovation Industrializes</strong>.
