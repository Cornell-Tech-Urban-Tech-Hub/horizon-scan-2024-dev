Cities face a fast-escalating climate crisis. The impacts of extreme heat, severe storms, and sea level rise are growing fast. At the same time, innovations in artificial intelligence (AI) are expanding our ability to model the risks ahead, optimize strategies for adaptation, and automate implementation of resilient designs. But intelligence machines aren't taking over. Our encounters with AI in the name of adaptation are teaching us how to evolve - by linking up human, machine, and non-human intelligences in ever-more fruitful ways.

As we enter this strange new world, this horizon scan is a handbook of anticipated discoveries, innovations, developments, and dangers to be found as we create new intelligence for urban climate adaptation over the decade ahead.
