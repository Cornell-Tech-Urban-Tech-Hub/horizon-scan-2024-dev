## How likely? How soon? What impact?

Each trend is tagged with three key pieces of data. You can use these to make sense of the changes ahead.

**Time frame** helps us approximate when to expect the trend’s effects to surge: soon (0 to 3 years), later (4 to 7 years), or eventually (8 to 10 years).

**Certainty** assesses our confidence level. Some trends describe unproven innovations, while others are more clearly attainable, or all but assured to be likely.

**Impact** gauges how wide the trend’s effects may reach. Sustaining innovations focus on efficiency and maintaining the status quo. Disruptive trends displace existing systems but often in self-serving ways. Transformative changes lead to long-term systemic change enabling viable new patterns.
