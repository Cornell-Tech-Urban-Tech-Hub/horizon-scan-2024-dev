title: Technology has transformed our climate. Can it help us prepare for the future we've unleashed?
---

Cities led efforts to stop greenhouse gas pollution. These efforts have grown more focused with each passing year. But the unmistakeable impacts of global heating - longer and more intense heat waves, more frequent and severe storms, and sea level rise - are already putting enormous stresses on cities. And so, even as cities continue to cut emissions, they are turning to address the impacts of warming that can no longer be avoided. The age of adaptation is upon us.

But cities face hard choices. The anticipated cost of urban climate adaptation could run in the trillions of dollars, with severe disruptions to the lives and livelihoods of citydwellers in the process. And while adaptation is a necessary countermeasure, it is also an opportunity for more than just reducing risk. Adaptation investments can produce many co-benefits that improve urban life, and offer an opportunity to address past injustices. But doing this effectively requires great care. And that's why urban climate planners are turning to urban technologists for tools that can amplify our capacity to change with the changing climate.

No technology offers more promise — and peril — than artificial intelligence. Whether expanding our ability to collect vital data on urban climate challenges; optimizing analyses that inform decisions on where, why, and how to act; or amplifying our capabilities to act through automation - artificial intelligence (AI) is rewriting our assumptions about what's possible in climate-changed cities. But AI also threatens to destabilize so many vital social, economic, and political systems. And it comes with its own colossal carbon footprint. 

How will people, machines, and non-human intelligences collaborate to rebuild a climate-changed world? We don't yet know, but its up to us to invent it. That's why we have created his horizon scan as a guide to anticipated developments and potential applications of AI for the challenge of urban climate adaptation. Use it to find your way.
