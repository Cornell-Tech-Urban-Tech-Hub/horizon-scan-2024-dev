### A Research Collaboration of Cornell Tech and UrbanAI

The [Urban Tech Hub at Cornell Tech](https://urban.tech.cornell.edu) is a new venture in New York City that generates applied research, fosters an expanding tech ecosystem, and cultivates the next generation of leaders in urban technology. Our goal is to shape the field of urban tech with a human-centered approach that focuses first on the people that use the technology. We advance technology research and education to build a better world by increasing access and opportunity within the tech sector.

[Urban AI](https://urbanai.fr) is a Paris-based think tank dedicated to the emerging field of Urban Artificial Intelligence. Urban AI seeks to generate a holistic body of knowledge on urban artificial intelligence by federating and collaborating with a growing, global community of researchers, public servants, start-ups, and urban subject matter experts, who work at the intersection of cities and technology. Together, they carry out multidisciplinary projects to better understand and assess the impacts of artificial intelligence on urban life and vice versa.
